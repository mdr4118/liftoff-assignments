## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our group has chosen to create an application that essentially an information data base
for any user in need of a centralized location to keep any and all information pertaining to 
health. Our Info Tracker includes, but is not limited to a user profile page with contact and emergency information. 
A medication database for current and past prescriptions with reminder function for not only when to take, but
also when a refill will be necessary. A symptom tracking page, a calendar, as well as a search feature. The application 
will also have a feature where the user can store any pertinent questions or concerns they may have for their primary care physician
or any specialist. From my own experience, I know I had questions I wanted to remember to ask a physician, but realized I 
had forgotten on the way home.

We feel that any time we see a medical professional, it can be a stressful time. In order to help alleviate even a fraction 
of that anxiety so a patient can be more present is the outcome we are looking for, when someone chooses to use an application 
such as ours.
